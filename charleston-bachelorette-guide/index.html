                <div class="col-lg-6">
                    <h3 class="h4">Diverse Experiences in One Location</h3>
                    <p>Charleston offers remarkable variety within a compact, accessible area. Downtown Charleston features cobblestone streets, historic architecture, upscale restaurants, and bustling nightlife along King Street and Upper King. Just 15-20 minutes away, beach communities like Isle of Palms, Sullivan's Island, and Folly Beach provide coastal relaxation and beach house party vibes.</p>
                    <p>This geographic diversity means your bachelorette group can experience sophisticated city entertainment one night and laid-back beach celebrations the next, all without long travel times or complicated logistics.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-6">
                    <h3 class="h4">Year-Round Bachelorette Destination</h3>
                    <p>Charleston's temperate climate makes it viable for bachelorette parties nearly year-round. Peak season runs from April through October when beach activities are optimal and outdoor dining thrives. However, shoulder seasons (March, November) offer pleasant weather with fewer crowds and often better accommodation rates.</p>
                    <p>Even winter months remain mild compared to northern destinations, with daytime temperatures often reaching the 50s and 60s‚Äîperfect for exploring downtown Charleston's historic attractions, waterfront views, and renowned culinary scene.</p>

                <div class="col-lg-6">
                    <h3 class="h4">Southern Hospitality and Safety</h3>
                    <p>Charleston consistently ranks among America's friendliest cities, with genuine Southern hospitality creating welcoming environments for visitors. Service industry professionals, from restaurant servers to hotel staff, typically provide attentive, gracious service that enhances bachelorette party experiences.</p>
                    <p>The city maintains relatively low crime rates in tourist areas, and downtown Charleston's walkability means groups can navigate easily on foot, reducing reliance on rideshares and keeping everyone together safely.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-6">
                    <h3 class="h4">Accessibility and Travel Convenience</h3>
                    <p>Charleston International Airport (CHS) offers direct flights from most major U.S. cities, making group travel logistics manageable. The airport sits just 12 miles from downtown Charleston and 25 miles from beach communities, with reasonable rideshare costs and rental car availability.</p>
                    <p>Groups driving from nearby cities like Charlotte (3.5 hours), Atlanta (4.5 hours), or cities along I-95 find Charleston easily accessible for road trip bachelorette weekends.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="alert alert-info">
                <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Book accommodations and major activities 6-8 weeks in advance for spring and summer bachelorette parties. Charleston's popularity means prime beach houses and downtown hotels fill quickly during peak wedding season (April-June, September-October).

        <!-- Accommodation Overview -->
        <section class="mb-5">
            <h2 class="section-title">Where to Stay: Charleston Bachelorette Accommodations</h2>
            <p>Accommodation choice significantly impacts your bachelorette party experience. Charleston offers diverse options from luxury downtown hotels to spacious beach house rentals, each providing different advantages for celebration styles.</p>

            <h3 class="h4 mt-4">Downtown Charleston Hotels</h3>
            <p>Staying downtown puts you within walking distance of King Street nightlife, Charleston City Market, Rainbow Row, and Waterfront Park. Top bachelorette-friendly hotels include The Dewberry Charleston (upscale luxury with rooftop bar), Hotel Bennett (modern sophistication near Marion Square), and The Spectator Hotel (boutique elegance on State Street).</p>
            <p>Downtown hotels work best for groups prioritizing nightlife, restaurant access, and urban exploration over beach time. Most downtown properties offer valet parking, concierge services, and proximity to Charleston's historic attractions.</p>

            <h3 class="h4 mt-4">Isle of Palms Beach Houses</h3>
            <p>Isle of Palms, located 20 minutes from downtown Charleston, offers the quintessential beach bachelorette experience. Large vacation rentals accommodate groups of 8-16+ comfortably, with private pools, beach access, spacious living areas, and full kitchens reducing meal costs.</p>
            <p>Isle of Palms combines relaxed beach vibes with convenient access to downtown Charleston for nightlife. The island features casual restaurants, beach bars like The Windjammer, and family-friendly atmosphere making it ideal for groups wanting beach relaxation with optional city excursions.</p>

            <h3 class="h4 mt-4">Folly Beach Rentals</h3>
            <p>Folly Beach, Charleston's "Edge of America," provides more laid-back, bohemian beach town energy compared to Isle of Palms. Located 20 minutes south of downtown, Folly Beach attracts surf culture, younger crowds, and casual beach bar scenes along Center Street.</p>
            <p>Folly Beach vacation rentals work well for budget-conscious groups wanting authentic beach town experiences without upscale resort pricing. The island's restaurants and bars are more casual, walking-friendly, and budget-friendly than other Charleston beach options.</p>

This family-friendly island features wide sandy beaches, numerous vacation rental options ranging from modest condos to luxury oceanfront estates, and casual dining at The Windjammer, Acme Lowcountry Kitchen, and The Boathouse at Breach Inlet.</p>
            <p>The island's Front Beach area near The Windjammer provides the most action with beach volleyball, live music, and bar atmosphere. Mid-island and Wild Dunes Resort areas offer quieter, more upscale beach experiences with championship golf courses and resort amenities.</p>

            <h3 class="h4 mt-4">Folly Beach</h3>

            <h3 class="h4 mt-4">Sullivan's Island</h3>
            <p>Sullivan's Island offers the most exclusive, quiet beach experience among Charleston's islands.

            <p>Station 22 provides Sullivan's Island's primary casual dining and drinks option. Poe's Tavern (named for Edgar Allan Poe who was stationed at Fort Moultrie) offers burgers and beers near the island's historic fort.

            <h2 class="section-title">Getting Around Charleston</h2>
            <p>Charleston navigation varies significantly between downtown and beach locations, affecting transportation planning for bachelorette groups.</p>

            <h3 class="h4 mt-4">Downtown Charleston Transportation</h3>
            <p>Downtown Charleston's compact, walkable layout means most Upper King Street nightlife and historic district exploration happens on foot. Walking from The Battery to Upper King takes roughly 30 minutes, covering most tourist areas. Rideshare services (Uber, Lyft) are abundant and inexpensive for longer trips or late nights when walking feels unsafe.</p>

            <h3 class="h4 mt-4">Beach to Downtown Transportation</h3>
            <p>Moving between beach accommodations and downtown Charleston requires vehicles. Rideshare trips from Isle of Palms or Folly Beach to downtown cost $35-50 each way. Groups staying at beaches typically designate drivers, rent passenger vans, or hire party bus services for downtown nightlife excursions.</p>
