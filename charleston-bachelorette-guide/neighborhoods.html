            <ul>
                <li><strong>Downtown Walking:</strong> Most efficient for peninsula neighborhoods. Comfortable shoes essential‚Äîcobblestones and uneven sidewalks common</li>
                <li><strong>Beach Transportation:</strong> Designate drivers, rent passenger vans, or budget for multiple rideshares if going downtown for nightlife</li>
                <li><strong>Rideshare Strategy:</strong> Request rides 5-10 minutes before actually needed on busy nights to account for wait times</li>
                <li><strong>Bike Rentals:</strong> Available through Holy Spokes and hotel programs, but challenging with evening drinking activities</li>
                <li><strong>Parking:</strong> Limited and expensive downtown. If driving, use hotel valet or parking garages ($20-30/day)</li>
